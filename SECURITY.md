# Security Policy

The FreeCAD project is a FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) project that has a community of thousands of users and
hundreds of developers worldwide. We encourage responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities that may affect users
of this software, and will endeavor to address these vulnerabilities when they are discovered.

## Bounties

FreeCAD does not have a program to pay bounties for security bugs. If you discover a vulnerability that affects a part
of the FreeCAD project (either directly in FreeCAD, in a library it depends on, or in any of the various other
subprojects such as our website, forums, etc.) we ask you to join the large community of volunteer contributors and
file a report about the issue.

Note that funds may be available from the [FreeCAD Project Association (FPA)](https://fpa.freecad.org) to pursue
security research and/or the development of fixes to any vulnerabilities discovered. However, vulnerabilities held as
hostage in demands for "bounties" will not be entertained. Contact the FPA at fpa@freecad.org for more information.

## Supported Versions

The Addon Manager implements security fixes to the main branch: the head of that branch is considered the latest
release, even if it has not yet been synchronized with the main FreeCAD source repository. Users can always update
their copy of the Addon Manager to the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability use GitHub's security reporting tool:
